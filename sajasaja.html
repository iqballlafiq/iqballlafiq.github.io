       <h1>FAVOURITE QUOTES</h1>
	<p>‚ÄúWinning doesn‚Äôt always mean being first. Winning means you‚Äôre doing better than you‚Äôve
done before.‚Äù</p>

	 <h1>How To Build A great Mindset</h1>
	<p>Self-trust mindset.</p>
	<p>To do anything great, you have to be able to trust yourself and believe in your capabilities. Success is not something that just happens but something you create. You have to have the confidence to banish any negative voices in your head. Don't give up on the things you believe in--and most important, don't give up on yourself.</p>
	<p>Goal-setting mindset.</p>
	<p>Knowing what you want and willing yourself to reach it are two different things. When you know your goals, they motivate you. Remember, if it doesn't challenge you, it won't change you. Set high goals and don't stop until you reach them.</p>
	<p>Patient mindset..</p>
	<p>There's a fine line between moving forward and standing still. The most successful people do all they can to move forward, but they also have the patience to wait and watch. Those who are impatient tend to lose out on great opportunities. Sometimes you have to wait for the right thing.</p>
	<p>Positive mindset.</p>
	<p>Choosing to be positive and having a good attitude will determine a lot about your life. If you set your mind to positivity it can go a long way. Be positive, not passive. Instead of giving yourself reasons why you can't or shouldn't, give yourself reasons why you can and permission to go for it. Happiness doesn't come from circumstances but always from within.</p>
